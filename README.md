# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification using CNN  

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify brain tumors into four categories:  
**Glioma Tumor**  
**Meningioma Tumor**  
**No Tumor**  
**Pituitary Tumor**  

The model is trained on **MRI scan images** to detect and differentiate tumor types accurately. A **Streamlit-based UI** has been added to allow users to **upload an MRI image and get predictions easily**.

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Deep Learning Model (CNN)** trained on MRI scans  
- **Streamlit UI** for easy image upload and classification  
- **Real-time Predictions** with confidence scores  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements  
Install the necessary dependencies before running the project:  
```sh
pip install streamlit tensorflow opencv-python pillow numpy
